A Simple CMS Project.

Explanation:
Public Listings is an app in which people can create accounts and post public listings for their companies. Public listings that a user creates are available only for him. There is a listings index page which displays all the listings and on clicking a listing title it redirects the user to a show page of that listing.

In this App the point was to use more of laravel commands and learning them. I went over providers and components something that I did not 	do with the CMS App ..
